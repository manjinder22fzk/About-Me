# About-Me
Welcome to my Github Profile .

# Manjinder Singh
I am a seasoned Data Scientist with a proven track record who has worked on several data science problems including Time Series, OCR Text Detection, and Object Detection using CNN and NLP.

While building projects, my primary focus is on creating a Production Ready Model. While working on any project, I divide the whole process into 3 processes:
 1. Research Phase - This is the phase where I analyze, visualize, transform, and extract features from my data in order to come up  with an optimal model along with       all the essential features.
 2. Packaging Phase - In this phase, I compile all of my analysis done in the research phase and build a CI/CD pipeline that can be dockerized and deployed on the        cloud.
 3. Deployment Phase - This is the most exciting phase for me. In this phase, I deploy the model on the AWS Cloud and then try the whole flow using completely new      data in order to see if the code breaks or not.

You will see all of my latest repositories designed in this fashion.

A major part of my  repositories are focused on the below problems:

 1. Object Detection using Yolo
 2. Sentiment Analysis using Gensim(NLP Package)
 3. AWS Cloud Deployment
 4. Time Series Forecast using ARIMA and Prophet
 5. OCT Detection using Detectron and Tesseract
